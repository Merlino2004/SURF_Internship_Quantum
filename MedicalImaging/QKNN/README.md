# QKNN
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the QKNN application discussed in the internship report. 

## Building a suited environment
Follow the steps below to build a virtual environment using Conda and then install the right packages using Pip:

1. ***Install Python***: Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed, as this was the version used during the code's modification, though other versions might also work.
3. ***Create environment***: Run the following command to create and activate an environment. Make sure you replace '[environment_name]' with the name you want to use, make sure you use a different name then your other environments.
```bash
conda create -n [environment_name]
conda activate [environment_name]
```
4. ***Installing required packages***: Run the following code to install the necessary packages, if you have a windows system:
```bash
pip install -r SURF_Internship_Quantum\MedicalImaging\QKNN\requirements.txt
```
Otherwise run:
```bash
pip install -r SURF_Internship_Quantum/MedicalImaging/QKNN/requirements.txt
```
Make sure you run the code in the newly created environment! Otherwise, errors will be displayed.
