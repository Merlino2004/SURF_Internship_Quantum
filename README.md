# SURF_Internship_Quantum
## Introduction
This repository contains all the code written during the internship at SURF. Three main applications were studied with quantum circuits during the internship: Medical imaging, Bayesian quadrature optimization in molecular dynamics, and partial differential equations. Descriptions of the applications can be found in the internship report. Tutorials on how to run the code on your own system can be found in the folder for the relevant application, which is named after the title given to it in the report. A tutorial on how to download the Github repository on your own system can be found down below, do this first!

## Copying Code 
To run the code locally, enter the following command in your computer's command prompt or terminal depending on your operating system: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Merlino2004/SURF_Internship_Quantum/tree/main
```
This downloads the entire repository to your system. Certain packages need to be installed for the code to run; these are detailed in the tutorial in the designated application's folder. It is recommended that you create different environments for each application, as this solves certain dependency issues. Once the necessary packages have been installed, open the scripts using the designated code editor and the code can be run!
